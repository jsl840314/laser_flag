Laser Flag: a squad-based tactical shooter inspired by XCom and Into The Breach

Players take turns moving teams of soldiers. Each soldier can move around the
map and fire his laser. Each turn a soldier may perform 3 actions, but firing
ends his turn (with exceptions). Soldiers move upon a grid and take up one grid
square each.

A soldier that has been hit has his laser gun deactivated and must touch home
base to recharge his laser.
    - Recharging consumes one AP.

Objective: first player to 25 points wins
    - hitting the enemy base is worth 5 points
    - hitting an enemy soldier is worth 2 points

Line-of-sight rules (tentative):
    create 81 lines:
        from shooter's 9 rect points to target's 9 rect points
        if any line does not collide with a wall, LOS is established



Soldiers can be one of three classes:
    SCOUTS can move quickly but are poor shooters       (+1 move, -1 attack)
    SNIPERS are slow movers but excellent shooters      (-1 move, +1 attack)
    GRUNTS are in between, but are better at defense    (+1 cover bonus)

    MOVEMENT RULES:
        each soldier gets 3 AP (action points) per turn (move or fire):
            GRUNT turn ends after firing once
            SCOUT may fire once and keep moving
            SNIPER moves and fires like a Grunt, except:
              may fire a second time if he has not moved this turn
                however, firing once cancels chance to enter overwatch
        each class moves at different speeds:
            GRUNT can move 5 squares per AP
            SNIPER can move 4
            SCOUT can move 6

        units can move diagonally but may not pass a wall corner
            diagonal motion is not inhibited by corners of cover or other units

OVERWATCH:
    a unit enters overwatch mode if he has APs remaining and has not fired:
        allows 1 reaction shot against the 1st enemy troop who lands in his LOS
    snap shot mode if he has 1 AP left: -1 attack penalty
    regular mode if he has 2 or 3 AP left: normal attack


TERRAIN:
    is a grid, the squares of which can be these classes:
        open terrain : the surface on which soldiers move.
        walls        : stop soldier movement and line-of-sight
        cover        : slow soldier movement but not line-of-sight
                       requires remainder of AP to climb

TACTICAL POSITIONS:
    a soldier is IN COVER against an enemy unit if:
        he is on level ground, adjacent to a cover square OR adjacent to a wall:
           he is IN COVER against any attacks that come from that cardinal direction
    a soldier is ELEVATED if he is on top of a cover object

a soldier IN COVER has a +2 defensive bonus
    a grunt in cover has a +3 defensive bonus
a soldier ELEVATED has a +1 attack bonus but a -2 defensive penalty




HIT DICE:
    roll 2D6 to determine hits
    base to-hit: must roll 7 or greater

        note: the enemy base is considered ELEVATED ground (-2 defensive penalty) for hit calculations
