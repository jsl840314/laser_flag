################################################################################
ROADMAP:
################################################################################

Need to implement scoring & victory conditions

Need to add overwatch rules

Need to add button to flash enemy LOS overwatch zones

Need to build a main menu / map loader

Need to build a map editor

Need to build a help screen

Expand map format to include rule modifications
    put it in JSON format maybe

Allow for various map sizes & shapes
    max 21 tiles
    min needs to be play tested, maybe 11


When all of the above are complete, issue v1.0.0


LOS is still a little bit hinky but maybe good enough

Maybe: fog of war option

Maybe: animate laser shots

Maybe: add sounds and music
    Mickey and Jeremy Ensley and Eric Morin help?

Clean up all images:
    remove tile edges on right and bottom of everything except walls
    adjust everything down to 39x39 except wall and floor
    make new 40x40 floor image, rotate randomly after loading:
        rotation = choice([0, 90, 180, 270])
        image = pygame.transform.rotate(image, rotation)

RULES:
################################################################################

Players take turns moving teams of units. Each unit can move around the
map and fire his laser. Each turn a unit may perform 3 actions, but firing
ends his turn (with exceptions). Soldiers move upon a grid and take up one grid
square each.

A unit that has been hit has his laser gun deactivated and must step on home
base to recharge his laser. Charging begins automatically; however, the unit
must wait until the next turn to fire again.
    - if the map does not include a base for that unit's team, the unit is
        eliminated from the game and removed from the board

Three possible game modes depending on the map:

    Capture the Flag: each team has at least one base
    Victory conditions: first to a set score AND/OR
                        highest score after set number of turns

    Assault: only one team has a base
    Victory conditions:  Capture the Flag victory conditions AND/OR:
                            team with no base is on offense
                            other team is on defense
                            offense tries to score as many points
                                as possible before all their units
                                are eliminated

    Elimination: no bases on the map
    Victory conditions: Capture the Flag victory conditions AND/OR:
                            last man standing wins

Map data will include turn limits and target scores
    - maps can be asymmetrical, so allow different target scores per team



Line-of-sight rules:
    If a line can be drawn from any part of a unit's square to any part of a
    target tile, without a wall blocking it, then the unit can hit that tile
    with his laser.

 (tentative algorithm):
    create 25 lines:
        from shooter's 4 corners and center to target's 4 corners and center
        if any line does not collide with a wall, LOS is established
    BASES hang from the ceiling and do not block any LOS


Soldiers can be one of three classes:
    SCOUTS can move quickly but are poor shooters       (+1 move, -1 attack)
    SNIPERS are slow movers but excellent shooters      (-1 move, +1 attack)
    GRUNTS are in between, but are better at defense    (+1 cover bonus)

    MOVEMENT RULES:
        each unit gets 3 AP (action points) per turn (move or fire):
            GRUNT turn ends after firing once
            SCOUT may fire once and keep moving
            SNIPER moves and fires like a Grunt, except:
              may fire a second time if he has not moved this turn
                however, firing once cancels chance to enter overwatch
        each class moves at different speeds:
            GRUNT can move 5 squares per AP
            SNIPER can move 4
            SCOUT can move 6

        units can move diagonally but may not pass a wall corner
            diagonal motion is not inhibited by corners of cover or other units

OVERWATCH:
    a unit enters overwatch mode if he has APs remaining and has not fired:
        allows 1 reaction shot against the 1st enemy troop who lands in his LOS
    snap shot mode if he has 1 AP left: -1 attack penalty
    regular mode if he has 2 or 3 AP left: normal attack


TERRAIN:
    a grid, maximum side 21x21 tiles, the squares of which can be:
        level   : no movement or LOS restrictions.
        wall    : stop unit movement and line-of-sight
        cover   : slow unit movement but not line-of-sight
                  requires remainder of AP to climb
        base    : same as level

TACTICAL POSITIONS:
    a unit is IN COVER against an enemy unit if:
        on level ground, adjacent to a cover square OR
        on any ground, adjacent to a wall:
            he is IN COVER against any attacks that come from that side
    a unit is ELEVATED if he is on top of a cover object

    a unit IN COVER has a +2 defensive bonus
        a grunt in cover has a +3 defensive bonus
    a unit ELEVATED has a +1 attack bonus but a -2 defensive penalty


HIT DICE:
    roll 2D6 to determine hits
    base to-hit: must roll 7 or greater

        NOTE: ENEMY BASE SHOULD MAYBE BE EASIER TO HIT; NEED TO PLAYTEST
