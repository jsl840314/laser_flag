Laser Flag, by Jesse Stuart Leitch

Version History:
v0.4.6  02/13/2023  moved lf_game.tiles to game_map.all_tiles
                    moved lf_game.walls to game_map.all_walls
                    added function to eliminate units if they have no bases
                        - for assault (one team has a recharging base) or
                          elimination (no recharging bases on the map) rules
v0.4.5  02/13/2023  cleaned up conditionals so that units with no laser can't
                    do target clicks
v0.4.4  02/13/2023  invented Grunt overwatch rules (3 shots but +3 penalty)
v0.4.3  02/13/2023  added some additional methods to the Unit superclass so
                        that each subclass has a place to implement bonuses
                    changed status indicator rules:
                        - black dots indicate remaining AP
                        - cyan / red to indicate whether unit can move
                        - laser recharge symbol if unit cannot fire
                    added option to view enemy sight lines
v0.4.2  02/12/2023  linked all color settings including unit circle
                    tweaked hit/miss report message and timer
                    fixed so target symbol disappears immediately after firing
v0.4.1  02/12/2023  added all roll calculations to status labels - still need
                    to actually implement them in the roll however
v0.4.0  02/12/2023  refactored unit and target selection methods
                    implemented roll calculation method and dictionary
                    cover & elevation systems seem to work
                    still need to report to labels
v0.3.6  02/12/2023  moved determine_range() and determine_los() calls from
                        main game loop into to the unit_move() method and stored
                        those values with unit class variables
v0.3.5  02/12/2023  moved build_teams to the game_map module
                    changed team-related buttons to dictionary entries
                    started refactoring _on_select_unit and _on_target_unit
                    moved Tile class to its own module
v0.3.4  02/11/2023  fixed the background lasers
v0.3.3  02/11/2023  organized the haphazard tile.point system
                    but something broke the background lasers
v0.3.2  02/11/2023  implemented scoring
v0.3.1  02/11/2023  put in some code to read version info from this file
v0.3.0  02/11/2023  implemented laser hits (on units) and recharging
v0.2.1  02/10/2023  moved the "move unit" method to the unit class
                    added a little D6 function
                    moved selection and deselection into their own methods
v0.2.0  02/10/2023  implemented flags in the LOS functions to decide corner
                            permissiveness
                    converted ASCII reader to a dictionary in settings
                    changed self.teams from a list to a dictionary
v0.1.1  02/10/2023  line-of-sight seems to be working properly
v0.1.0  02/10/2023  implemented basic line-of-sight; still buggy
v0.0.2  02/09/2023  a bit more refactoring; fixed a bug with climbing units
v0.0.1  02/08/2023  refactored a bunch of shit
v0.0.0  02/08/2023  map-loading and movement rules complete


################################################################################
ROADMAP:
################################################################################

Make a button to show game rules
   put it where the laser button appears
   click-and-hold to display

Need to add overwatch rules
   after unit move, send self to check_overwatch() in game_map to check for enemy overwatch
   
   game_map.check_overwatch() looks at each enemy unit with -AP to see if recently moved unit is visible
   if True, roll attack
       if hit, end loop
       if not hit, check for more attacks from current enemy unit, then remainder of list

   

#####################
FIRST PLAYABLE ALPHA
#####################

Implement a second base type:

    wall bases can be shot for extra points
        - unit must touch one of 8 adjoining tiles to recharge

    floor bases can be blocked by enemy units
        - unit must stand on tile to recharge

Need to add victory conditions

refine LOS line generating to draw denser lines, but only draw lines
from appropriate tile faces:
    _Tile class should contain 8 dictionaries, each one containing a set of
        corner points
    LOS calculator just needs another elif to generate a new set of test lines

build a main menu / map loader

build a map editor

build a help screen

expand map format to include rule modifications
    put it in JSON format maybe

Allow for various map sizes & shapes
    max 21 tiles
    min needs to be play tested, maybe 11

################################################
When all of the above are complete, issue v1.0.0
################################################

Maybe: fog of war option

Maybe: animate laser shots

Maybe: add sounds and music
    Mickey and Jeremy Ensley and Eric Morin help?

Clean up all images:
    remove tile edges on right and bottom of everything except walls
    adjust everything down to 39x39 except wall and floor
    make new 40x40 floor image, rotate randomly after loading:
        rotation = choice([0, 90, 180, 270])
        image = pygame.transform.rotate(image, rotation)



################################################################################
RULES:
################################################################################

Players take turns moving teams of units. Each unit can move around the
map and fire his laser. Each turn a unit may perform 3 actions, but firing
ends his turn (with exceptions). Soldiers move upon a grid and take up one grid
square each.

A unit that has been hit has his laser gun deactivated and must step on home
base to recharge his laser. Charging begins automatically; however, the unit
must wait until the next turn to fire again.
    - if the map does not include a base for that unit's team, the unit is
        eliminated from the game and removed from the board

Three possible game modes depending on the map:

    Capture the Flag: each team has at least one base
    Victory conditions: all enemy units are discharged and bases are blocked AND/OR
                        first to a set score AND/OR
                        highest score after set number of turns AND/OR



    Assault: only one team has a base
    Victory conditions:  Capture the Flag victory conditions AND/OR:
                            team with no base is on offense
                            other team is on defense
                            offense tries to score as many points
                                as possible before all their units
                                are eliminated

    Elimination: no bases on the map
    Victory conditions: Capture the Flag victory conditions AND/OR:
                            last man standing wins

Map data will include turn limits and target scores
    - maps can be asymmetrical, so allow different target scores per team



Line-of-sight rules:
    If a line can be drawn from any part of a unit's square to any part of a
    target tile, without a wall blocking it, then the unit can hit that tile
    with his laser.

 (tentative algorithm):
    create 25 lines:
        from shooter's 4 corners and center to target's 4 corners and center
        if any line does not collide with a wall, LOS is established
    BASES hang from the ceiling and do not block any LOS


Units can be plain, or one of three classes:

    SCOUTS can move quickly but are poor shooters
        (+1 move, -1 attack)
        ALSO after firing can keep moving

    SNIPERS are slow movers but excellent shooters
        (-1 move, +1 attack)
        ALSO after firing can keep firing

    GRUNTS are in between, but are better at defense
        (+1 cover defense bonus, -1 elevation attack bonus)
        ALSO can perform 3 overwatch shot but has +3 penalty


    MOVEMENT RULES:
        each unit gets 3 AP (action points) per turn to use for movement or firing:
            GRUNT turn ends after firing once
            SCOUT may fire once and keep moving
            SNIPER may keep firing but cannot move again
        each class moves at different speeds:
            GRUNT can move 5 squares per AP
            SNIPER can move 4
            SCOUT can move 6

        units can move diagonally but may not pass a wall corner
            diagonal motion is not inhibited by corners of cover or other units

OVERWATCH:
    a unit enters overwatch mode if he has APs remaining and has not fired:
        -   allows reaction shots against enemy unit who lands in his LOS but
            with a +2 penalty
        -   can only take a maximum of 2 shots, even if ending with 3 AP
            - Grunt gets a maximum of 3 but his penalty is increased





TERRAIN:
    a grid, maximum side 21x21 tiles, the squares of which can be:
        level    : no movement or LOS restrictions.
        wall     : stop unit movement and line-of-sight
        elevated : slow unit movement but not line-of-sight
                   requires remainder of AP to climb
        base     : same as level

TACTICAL POSITIONS:
    a unit is IN COVER against an enemy unit if:
        on level ground, adjacent to a cover square OR
        on any ground, adjacent to a wall:
            he is IN COVER against any attacks that come from that side
    a unit is ELEVATED if he is on top of a cover object

    a unit IN COVER has a +2 defensive bonus
        a grunt in cover has a +3 defensive bonus
    a unit ELEVATED has a +2 attack bonus but a -2 defensive penalty
        a grunt only gets a +1 attack bonus


HIT DICE:
    roll 2D6 to determine hits
    base to-hit: must roll 7 or greater

        NOTE: ENEMY BASE SHOULD MAYBE BE EASIER TO HIT; NEED TO PLAYTEST
