Laser Flag, by Jesse Stuart Leitch

Version History:
v0.5.4  02/14/2023  started adding a rules screen
                    added cover info to status boxes
                    gave buttons/labels the ability to show 3 lines
v0.5.3  02/14/2023  revised overwatch rules; reaction shots are triggered by
                        firing as well as moving
                    more image revisions; probably good enough for alpha
v0.5.2  02/14/2023  changed rule for scouts: eliminated free move after shot but
                        they can now climb onto elevated ground without
                        consuming the remainder of the AP
                    implemented alt team colors
                    new unit icons
                    cleaned up a few more images
v0.5.1  02/14/2023  had some bugs in the overwatch system so moved all unit
                        firing action into one base method, to be overridden by
                        sniper and scout classes. Seems to work smoothly.
                    revised unit icons and added alt color polygons to class defs
v0.5.0  02/13/2023  basic overwatch rules implemented
v0.4.6  02/13/2023  moved lf_game.tiles to game_map.all_tiles
                    moved lf_game.walls to game_map.all_walls
                    added function to eliminate units if they have no bases
                        - for assault (one team has a recharging base) or
                          elimination (no recharging bases on the map) rules
v0.4.5  02/13/2023  cleaned up conditionals so that units with no laser can't
                        click targets
                    simplified Grunt rules: "everything +/-3 instead of 2"
v0.4.4  02/13/2023  invented Grunt overwatch rules (3 shots but +3 penalty)
v0.4.3  02/13/2023  added some additional methods to the Unit superclass so
                        that each subclass has a place to implement bonuses
                    changed status indicator rules:
                        - black dots indicate remaining AP
                        - cyan / red to indicate whether unit can move
                        - laser recharge symbol if unit cannot fire
                    added option to view enemy sight lines
v0.4.2  02/12/2023  linked all color settings including unit circle
                    tweaked hit/miss report message and timer
                    fixed so target symbol disappears immediately after firing
v0.4.1  02/12/2023  added all roll calculations to status labels - still need
                    to actually implement them in the roll however
v0.4.0  02/12/2023  refactored unit and target selection methods
                    implemented roll calculation method and dictionary
                    cover & elevation systems seem to work
                    still need to report to labels
v0.3.6  02/12/2023  moved determine_range() and determine_los() calls from
                        main game loop into to the unit_move() method and stored
                        those values with unit class variables
v0.3.5  02/12/2023  moved build_teams to the game_map module
                    changed team-related buttons to dictionary entries
                    started refactoring _on_select_unit and _on_target_unit
                    moved Tile class to its own module
v0.3.4  02/11/2023  fixed the background lasers
v0.3.3  02/11/2023  organized the haphazard tile.point system
                    but something broke the background lasers
v0.3.2  02/11/2023  implemented scoring
v0.3.1  02/11/2023  put in some code to read version info from this file
v0.3.0  02/11/2023  implemented laser hits (on units) and recharging
v0.2.1  02/10/2023  moved the "move unit" method to the unit class
                    added a little D6 function
                    moved selection and deselection into their own methods
v0.2.0  02/10/2023  implemented flags in the LOS functions to decide corner
                            permissiveness
                    converted ASCII reader to a dictionary in settings
                    changed self.teams from a list to a dictionary
v0.1.1  02/10/2023  line-of-sight seems to be working properly
v0.1.0  02/10/2023  implemented basic line-of-sight; still buggy
v0.0.2  02/09/2023  a bit more refactoring; fixed a bug with climbing units
v0.0.1  02/08/2023  refactored a bunch of shit
v0.0.0  02/08/2023  map-loading and movement rules complete

ROADMAP:
################################################################################

Make a button to show game rules
   put it where the laser button appears
   click-and-hold to display



Players take turns controlling teams of units in a game of laser tag. Each unit
may perform three actions per turn. An action point (AP) may be used to move a
certain number of squares, or to fire a laser. Firing consumes the remainder of
that unit's AP, with a few exceptions.

The map consists of floor, cover, and walls. A unit adjacent to a wall
or cover tile is "in cover" in a 180° arc in that direction. Units may stand
on cover tiles to an elevated position, but climbing consumes the remainder of
that AP (with an exception). An elevated unit may still take cover next to walls.

Lasers may be fired at any opposing unit within line-of-sight. A successful hit
(determined by by the sum of two D6 dice) is worth one point, and deactivates
the target's laser. To reactivate a laser, the unit must return to a base tile.

A unit that retinas some AP at the end of the turn may return fire during enemy
moves; but with a roll penalty. Any enemy action performed within line-of-sight
of an eligible unit will trigger a snap shot. If multiple units have line of
sight, they will all fire unless a hit is scored. Units onlt fire once per
overwatch round.

Plain unit: move 5 squares per AP
            roll 7 or greater to hit
            +2 defense bonus if in cover
            -2 defense penalty if on elevated ground
            -2 attack bonus (low rolls are better) if on elevated ground
            max 2 AP carried into enemy turn for snapshots
            +2 attack penalty for snap shots

These sub-classes use the same rules with these exceptions:

    Grunt:  +3 defense bonus if in cover
            -3 defense penalty if on elevated ground
            -3 attack bonus if on elevated ground     # maybe change those to 1?
            max 3 AP carry over for snap shots
            +3 attack penalty for snap shots

    Sniper: move 4 squares per AP
            roll 6 or greater to hit
            firing only consumes 1 AP, but must stay in place after firing

    Scout:  move 6 squares per AP
            roll 8 or greater to hit
            no penalty for climbing onto cover



You can only fire at a deactivated enemy unit if he is standing on your base



#############################################
FIRST PLAYABLE ALPHA READY FOR FRIEND TESTING
#############################################

holy FUCK I just realized that shooting bases NEVER needs to happen:
    if you occupy all enemy bases and deactivate all their lasers, you win
    otherwise first to a set score wins. Just need to implement 3 victory conditions:
        - map score limit hit
        - all enemies eliminated
        - checkmate: all enemy bases occupied and all enemy lasers deactivated

Implement a second base type:

    wall bases can be shot for extra points
        - unit must touch one of 8 adjoining tiles to recharge

    floor bases can be blocked by enemy units
        - unit must stand on tile to recharge

Need to add victory conditions

refine LOS line generating to draw denser lines, but only draw lines
from appropriate tile faces:
    _Tile class should contain 8 dictionaries, each one containing a set of
        corner points
    LOS calculator just needs another elif to generate a new set of test lines

build a main menu / map loader

build a map editor

build a help screen

expand map format to include rule modifications
    put it in JSON format maybe

Allow for various map sizes & shapes
    max 21 tiles
    min needs to be play tested, maybe 11

################################################
When all of the above are complete, issue v1.0.0
################################################

Maybe: fog of war option

Maybe: add sounds and music
    Mickey and Jeremy Ensley and Eric Morin help?


################################################################################
DESIGN GOALS:
################################################################################

A game that combines:   XCom-style cover tactics
                        the perfect information of Into The Breach
                        BUT is a two-player game

################################################################################
RULES:
################################################################################

Players take turns moving teams of units.

Each unit can move around the map and fire his laser.

Each turn a unit may perform 3 actions; either moves or laser shots.

A unit that has been hit has his laser gun deactivated and must step on home
base to recharge his laser. Charging begins automatically; however, the unit
must wait until the next turn to fire again.
    - if the map does not include a base for that unit's team, the unit is
        eliminated from the game and removed from the board

UNIT CLASSES:
Basic:  can move 5 tiles per action
        must roll 7 or higher to hit (add 2 D6 dice)
        may fire once per turn
        cannot move after firing
        if on elevated ground:
            -(2) attack bonus
            -(2) defense penalty
        if in cover (180° arc):
            +(2) defense bonus
        If APs are left at end of turn:
            (2) may be used as snapshots on enemy turn
            +(2) attack penalty on snapshots

Grunt:  Same as Basic but (3) for every (2) above;
            including number of Overwatch shots

Scout:  May continue to move after firing;
            remaining APs convert to Overwatch
        +1 movement speed
        +1 attack penalty

Sniper: May continue to fire, but must stop moving;
            remaining APs convert to Overwatch
        -1 movement speed
        -1 attack bonus




Three possible game modes depending on the map:

    Capture the Flag: each team has at least one base
    Victory conditions: all enemy units are discharged and bases are blocked AND/OR
                        first to a set score AND/OR
                        highest score after set number of turns AND/OR



    Assault: only one team has a base
    Victory conditions:  Capture the Flag victory conditions AND/OR:
                            team with no base is on offense
                            other team is on defense
                            offense tries to score as many points
                                as possible before all their units
                                are eliminated

    Elimination: no bases on the map
    Victory conditions: Capture the Flag victory conditions AND/OR:
                            last man standing wins

Map data will include turn limits and target scores
    - maps can be asymmetrical, so allow different target scores per team



Line-of-sight rules:
    If a line can be drawn from any part of a unit's square to any part of a
    target tile, without a wall blocking it, then the unit can hit that tile
    with his laser.

 (tentative algorithm):
    create 25 lines:
        from shooter's 4 corners and center to target's 4 corners and center
        if any line does not collide with a wall, LOS is established
    BASES hang from the ceiling and do not block any LOS


Units can be plain, or one of three classes:

    SCOUTS can move quickly but are poor shooters
        (+1 move, -1 attack)
        ALSO after firing can keep moving

    SNIPERS are slow movers but excellent shooters
        (-1 move, +1 attack)
        ALSO after firing can keep firing

    GRUNTS are in between, but are better at defense
        (+1 cover defense bonus, -1 elevation attack bonus)
        ALSO can perform 3 overwatch shot but has +3 penalty


    MOVEMENT RULES:
        each unit gets 3 AP (action points) per turn to use for movement or firing:
            GRUNT turn ends after firing once
            SCOUT may fire once and keep moving
            SNIPER may keep firing but cannot move again
        each class moves at different speeds:
            GRUNT can move 5 squares per AP
            SNIPER can move 4
            SCOUT can move 6

        units can move diagonally but may not pass a wall corner
            diagonal motion is not inhibited by corners of cover or other units

OVERWATCH:
    a unit enters overwatch mode if he has APs remaining and has not fired:
        -   allows reaction shots against enemy unit who lands in his LOS but
            with a +2 penalty
        -   can only take a maximum of 2 shots, even if ending with 3 AP
            - Grunt gets a maximum of 3 but his penalty is increased





TERRAIN:
    a grid, maximum side 21x21 tiles, the squares of which can be:
        level    : no movement or LOS restrictions.
        wall     : stop unit movement and line-of-sight
        elevated : slow unit movement but not line-of-sight
                   requires remainder of AP to climb
        base     : same as level

TACTICAL POSITIONS:
    a unit is IN COVER against an enemy unit if:
        on level ground, adjacent to a cover square OR
        on any ground, adjacent to a wall:
            he is IN COVER against any attacks that come from that side
    a unit is ELEVATED if he is on top of a cover object

    a unit IN COVER has a +2 defensive bonus
        a grunt in cover has a +3 defensive bonus
    a unit ELEVATED has a +2 attack bonus but a -2 defensive penalty
        a grunt only gets a +1 attack bonus



RULE-SET "STORY":

A normal laser that has fired takes a moment to cool
down, so it's inactive for the rest of the turn.

Grunts and Basic units need to take their
time aiming, so they can't move after firing.

Scouts can run while firing, but aren't very good shots.

Snipers are good shots with their special lasers that don't need to cool down;
but they are slow movers, and like other units they cannot move after firing.

Units on overwatch have to react quickly to enemy moves, so they suffer an
accuracy penalty. However, their laser has time to cool down between shots.




HIT DICE:
    roll 2D6 to determine hits
    base to-hit: must roll 7 or greater

        NOTE: ENEMY BASE SHOULD MAYBE BE EASIER TO HIT; NEED TO PLAYTEST
