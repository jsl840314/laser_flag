RULES:
################################################################################

Players take turns moving teams of soldiers. Each soldier can move around the
map and fire his laser. Each turn a soldier may perform 3 actions, but firing
ends his turn (with exceptions). Soldiers move upon a grid and take up one grid
square each.

A unit that has been hit has his laser gun deactivated and must touch home base
to recharge his laser. Charging begins immediately; however, the unit must wait
until the next turn to fire again.
    - if the map does not include a base for that unit's team, the unit is
        eliminated from the game and removed from the board

Three possible game modes depending on the map:

    Capture the Flag: each team has at least one base
        Victory conditions: first to a set score AND/OR
                            highest score after set number of turns

    Assault: only one team has a base
        Victory conditions:  Capture the Flag victory conditions AND/OR:
                                team with no base is on offense
                                other team is on defense
                                offense tries to score as many points as possible
                                    before all their units are eliminated

    Elimination: no bases on the map
        Victory conditions: Capture the Flag victory conditions AND/OR:
                                last man standing wins

Map data will include turn limits and target scores
    - maps can be asymmetrical, so allow different target scores per team



Line-of-sight rules:
    If a line can be drawn from any part of a unit's square to any part of a
    target tile, without a wall blocking it, then the unit can hit that tile
    with his laser.

 (tentative algorithm):
    create 25 lines:
        from shooter's 4 corners and center to target's 4 corners and center
        if any line does not collide with a wall, LOS is established
    BASES hang from the ceiling and do not block any LOS


Soldiers can be one of three classes:
    SCOUTS can move quickly but are poor shooters       (+1 move, -1 attack)
    SNIPERS are slow movers but excellent shooters      (-1 move, +1 attack)
    GRUNTS are in between, but are better at defense    (+1 cover bonus)

    MOVEMENT RULES:
        each soldier gets 3 AP (action points) per turn (move or fire):
            GRUNT turn ends after firing once
            SCOUT may fire once and keep moving
            SNIPER moves and fires like a Grunt, except:
              may fire a second time if he has not moved this turn
                however, firing once cancels chance to enter overwatch
        each class moves at different speeds:
            GRUNT can move 5 squares per AP
            SNIPER can move 4
            SCOUT can move 6

        units can move diagonally but may not pass a wall corner
            diagonal motion is not inhibited by corners of cover or other units

OVERWATCH:
    a unit enters overwatch mode if he has APs remaining and has not fired:
        allows 1 reaction shot against the 1st enemy troop who lands in his LOS
    snap shot mode if he has 1 AP left: -1 attack penalty
    regular mode if he has 2 or 3 AP left: normal attack


TERRAIN:
    a grid, maximum side 21x21 tiles, the squares of which can be:
        open terrain : the surface on which soldiers move.
        walls        : stop soldier movement and line-of-sight
        cover        : slow soldier movement but not line-of-sight
                       requires remainder of AP to climb

TACTICAL POSITIONS:
    a soldier is IN COVER against an enemy unit if:
        he is on level ground, adjacent to a cover square OR on any ground, adjacent to a wall:
           he is IN COVER against any attacks that come from that cardinal direction
    a soldier is ELEVATED if he is on top of a cover object

a soldier IN COVER has a +2 defensive bonus
    a grunt in cover has a +3 defensive bonus
a soldier ELEVATED has a +1 attack bonus but a -2 defensive penalty




HIT DICE:
    roll 2D6 to determine hits
    base to-hit: must roll 7 or greater

        note: the enemy base is considered ELEVATED ground (-2 defense penalty)
        for hit calculations

        scout on LEVEL ground:
            need  8 or better to hit LEVEL    enemy   (42%)
            need 10 or better to hit IN COVER enemy   (17%)
            need 11 or better to hit IN COVER grunt   (8%)
            need  6 or better to hit ELEVATED enemy   (72%)
        scout on ELEVATED ground:
            need  7 or better to hit LEVEL    enemy   (58%)
            need  9 or better to hit IN COVER enemy   (28%)
            need 10 or better to hit IN COVER grunt   (17%)

            need  8 or better to hit IN COVER enemy   (42%)
            need  9 or better to hit IN COVER grunt   (28%)
